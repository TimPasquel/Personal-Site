<p>I made this website for a couple of different reasons. One of the main reasons is because of one of my <a href="https://www.aidanlapenta.com">friends</a> in college made his own website and gave his philisophy as to why having your own wesbite would be a cool thing to do. The major takeaway was that in the current day and age, the internet is dominated by a select few tech companies who control what can and can not be done. However, making your own website on your own sever gives one the freedom to do whatever they want and however they want. An in depth breakdown of this idea can be further explored on Luke Smithâ€™s webspage. Luke Smith was also, was the one who walked me through how to actually set up this website, that video can be found here. Another reason was because for someone studying Information Technology and Computer Science, setting up your own website and server is just a fun project to accomplish and brag about. Finally, its just the professional thing to do. One is able to put anything they would like on the site such as a digital resume, project list, personal business, etc. Setting the site up was a fairly simple process, one just needs to set aside ample amount of time to figure out and problem solve the couple of issues that do end up coming up along the way. Overall, setting up the site was a fun and educational learning experience.</p>
<p>The sites domain was registered using Epik, the server is hosted on a Vultr virtual server (making the cost of running the site very cheap as you do not have to worry about electricy, upgrading hardware, having people go through your network traffic, much less of a hassle than a standard local server), and the languages used for creation (as of the writing of this log) are html, css, and php.</p>
<p>Overall, I hope more people hope onto the train of making their own sites using the resources above as it really is a simple process, and is more flexible platform.</p>
